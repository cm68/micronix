     [1mint0.h [22m‐ header file for C preprocessor


[1mFUNCTION[0m
     int0.h contains structure definitions and constants used on‐
     ly by the C preprocessor.

     [1mLEX ‐[0m
          is an int used to hold token codes, e.g. PCHCON,  which
          are never zero.

     [1mINCL ‐[0m
          is  a  structure  used  to  control an open file.  next
          points to any pending files,  if  this  is  an  include
          file.   fname  is either NULL or points to an allocated
          filename, for diagnostics.  nline is the  current  line
          number  in  the file, for diagnostics.  pfio is the FIO
          control buffer for the file.

     [1mPRETAB ‐[0m
          is the structure used for  predefined  tables  of  key‐
          words,  operators,  etc.   prename  points  to the name
          string, which begins with a byte containing  length  of
          the string, to save scanning the name for its terminat‐
          ing null.  pretype is the encoded  token  type,  always
          non‐zero.   PRETAB arrays must be sorted on the prename
          strings.

     [1mTLIST ‐[0m
          is the structure of an entry in the token list used  to
          describe  input lines and definitions.  Each entry rep‐
          resents zero or more characters of leading  whitespace,
          followed  by  zero or more characters of the actual to‐
          ken; PEOL is the only token  with  a  length  of  zero.
          next  points to the next item in the list.  type is the
          token type, always non‐zero; token lists invariably end
          in an EOL token.  type is one of: PCHCON for ’...’, PE‐
          OL for end of line, PIDENT  for  identifier,  PNUM  for
          number,  PPUNCT  for  punctuation,  PSTRING  for "...".
          white points at the whitespace string preceding the to‐
          ken.   nwhite  is  the  number of whitespace characters
          starting at white.  text points to  the  start  of  the
          defining  text  for  the token.  ntext is the number of
          characters in the text string.

     [1mALIST ‐[0m
          is the structure of an argument list  element  for  the
          expansion  of  a  macro with arguments.  next points to
          the next argument.  astart points at the first token in
          the  argument token list.  aend points at the first to‐
          ken beyond the argument token list.

     [1mDEF ‐[0m
          is the  symbol  table  structure  for  #defines.   next
          points to the next older entry in this definition list.
          dnlen is the  length  of  the  definition  name.   defn
          points to the first token in the definition token list;
          it is always non‐NULL.  dname is the definition name.

     [1mARGS ‐[0m
          is the structure filled in by getflags for the ‐d argu‐
          ments  from the command line.  ntop is the index of the
          highest  free  entry  in  anames;  zero  implies  full.
          anames  is  the  array of text pointers for each of the
          arguments, filled in from the top down.

[1mFUNCTION[0m
     p1  sends a stream of commands to p2 that describes the code
     to be generated in a  rather  machine  independent  fashion.
     int12.h  descibes the language of these commands, plus other
     constants common to the two passes.

     Some p2s requires that pointers be four bytes long (‐l  flag
     in  p1),  others  require  that  pointers be two bytes long.
     There is no explicit indication of what p1 uses in  the  in‐
     termediate  file,  but curious behavior of p2 will result if
     the wrong pointers are used.

     [1mREGISTERS ‐[0m
          describe the machine independent  register  allocation.
          ARGIDX  is  the  base register from which arguments are
          referenced, counting up from zero.  AUTIDX is the  base
          register from which automatics are referenced, counting
          down from zero.  Results up to integer in width are re‐
          turned  in  INTRET,  longs  in  LONGRET,  and floats in
          FLTRET.  REGSET is the bit mask of all available  allo‐
          catable  registers.   Note  that  the values chosen for
          these symbols are rather precious, since both p1 and p2
          depend upon subtle relationships among them.

     [1mCREATED OPERATORS ‐[0m
          are those operators created by p1 and sent to p2: DADDR
          is the & unary operator, DALIST is the comma in an  ar‐
          gument  list,  DCAST is the cast operator, DGMIN is the
          post decrement operator, DELIST is the comma in an  ex‐
          pression  list,  DFNCALL  is a function call with argu‐
          ments, DFNONLY is a function call  with  no  arguments,
          DGPLU  is  the  post  increment operator, DINDIR is the
          unary * operator, DMINUS is the unary ‐ operator, DPLUS
          is the unary + operator, DCMP is the generic comparison
          operator, DGETS is a form of = used in p1 to avoid cer‐
          tain lvalue checks, DLESS is a generic order comparison
          operator used in some p2s.

     [1mPASS TWO TYPES‐[0m
          describes the basic types sent between passes after FN‐
          RET, ARRAY, and PTRTO have been eliminated.

     [1mINTERFACE COMMANDS ‐[0m
          are those commands sent between passes.  The intermedi‐
          ate file consists of zero or more commands,  terminated
          by end of file or a null command.  The commands are:

             GAUTOFF long            ; current auto lo water mark
             GCASE label                     ; a case label
             GDATA bound name        ; a data name and boundary
             GDEF name                       ; a definition to be made external
             GFLOAT count chars      ; a ’count’ length float constant
             GFUNC name                      ; a function start
             GGEQ
             GGREAT
             GINT count long         ; a ’count’ length integer constant
             GISEQ
             GJUMP label                     ; jump to label
             GLABEL label            ; a label
             GLESS
             GLEQ
             GLITS bound name        ; a literal name and boundary
             GNOTEQ label l r        ; l COND r jump label
             GREF name                       ; a reference to external name
             GREGS regs                      ; the current reg hi water mark
             GRET                            ; a return statement
             GSPACE count            ; reserve ’count’ bytes
             GSTRING count str       ; a string of ’count’ bytes
             GSWITCH label           ; a switch statement
             GVOID l                         ; gen code for expr l
             GSWEND                          ; switch end
             GSWTAB bound name       ; a switch table name and boundary
             GADDR+bnd name long     ; gen an address constant

     In  the  above, name consists of a one byte length, followed
     by the appropriate number of name bytes; long is a four byte
     integer, label is a two byte integer; bound, count, and regs
     are one byte integers; str is a sequence of length bytes;  l
     and r are expression trees; and bnd is the boundary enforced
     for the address initializer, or 4 for a function address.

     An expression is recursively defined as either a ternary op‐
     erator  (?:)  followed by three expressions; a binary opera‐
     tor, followed by two expressions; a unary operator, followed
     by one; or a zero operator, followed by a term.  In all cas‐
     es, the type of the result follows the operator as a  single
     byte;  if  the type is XPTRTO, its high four bits contains a
     bnd as for GADDR, giving the boundary enforced for the thing
     pointed  to.   A  term consists of a name, a long offset, an
     idx byte to specify a base register,  and  a  refs  byte  to
     specify the level of indirection.

     The address of a general term in p1 or p2 is:

        refs    value
         0              &name+offset[idx]
         1               name+offset[idx]
         2              *name+offset[idx]
         3              **name+offset[idx]
        etc.

     i.e.,  an  optional symbolic location name, plus a long off‐
     set, optionally indexed by a register; where (refs == 0) im‐
     plies  the  address  itself,  (refs == 1) implies direct ad‐
     dressing, and higher values of  refs  implies  indirect  ad‐
     dressing to one or more levels.  If only idx is nonzero, the
     register contents is implied; if only offset is  nonzero,  a
     long resolution constant is implied; if all fields are zero,
     a constant zero is implied.

     Note that there are additional semantic constraints  imposed
     on  this language, such as correspondence between labels and
     jumps, location of function headers, etc.  Since p2  is  not
     equipped  to  diagnose  user errors, this file is always as‐
     sumed to be well formed semantically.

     [1mp2tab.c [22m‐ tables for code generation


[1mFUNCTION[0m
     p2tab.c  contains  the tables used for code generation, plus
     several unrelated functions for low‐level input and output.

     The table encodings are described clearly in the comment  at
     the  beginning  of  p2tab.c  Usage of the text byte codes is
     found in p2gen.c.  Be warned, however, that the ordering  of
     each  table  is  important, to ensure that there is always a
     strategy that succeeds.  gettab,  in  particular,  has  been
     finely  honed  to balance optimization against completeness;
     muck around at your peril.

     binops indexes bintab to select the appropriate code table.

     getch and putch implement a  simple  buffering  scheme  that
     markedly  improves  execution time with little investment in
     space.  putasm is a tailored format  drived  output  routine
     that converts a number of internal shorthands into A‐Natural
     code.  It also returns a value carefully contrived  to  make
     emit work right in conjunction with chread.

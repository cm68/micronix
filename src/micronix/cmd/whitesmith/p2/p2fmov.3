[1mFUNCTION[0m
     p2fmov.c is the code necessary to move a scalar operand from
     one kind of addressable location to another.  All  the  code
     here  indicates the great difficulty in writing an 8080 code
     generator, as it is equivalent to a simple move  instruction
     on saner computers.

     Each  of the force tables deals with moving a different type
     of operand, possibly transforming it in the  process:  dbmem
     moves a double to memory, using the canned sequence ’\4’ ex‐
     panded by putasm; dbstk moves a double onto the stack, using
     ’\5’ in different ways; deref performs one level of indirect
     address dereferencing; intreg gets an int into  a  register;
     intmem  gets an int into memory; intstk gets an int onto the
     stack; lomem gets a long into memory; lostk gets a long onto
     the  stack; ptmov moves a pointer about, without dereferenc‐
     ing it; and reref computes a pointer  which  is  a  register
     plus displacement.

     Aside  from special tables such as deref and reref, most ta‐
     bles are selected in force by scanning ftab.  The first  en‐
     try  says,  for  instance, that if you want a pointer in hl,
     and hl is in the set of resources, and the type of the oper‐
     and  is  no  larger than double (i.e. any type), then by all
     means use the table ptmov.  The ptmov table  will,  in  turn
     specify  which  entry to use to load the pointer into hl (it
     must have a code of 01xx), depending upon where it’s  coming
     from and what other registers it must make use of.

     emit  is  ill placed; it is probably better off in p2main.c,
     except for  space  considerations.   Similarly,  the  tables
     binops  and  optytab,  and  the  functions  opick, pick, and
     twant, have found there way here for  curious  reasons  that
     display little residual logic.

     binops  indexes bintab to select the appropriate code table.
     optytab, which is also indexed by binops, specifies  whether
     equivalent  types  are  acceptable  for the left operand (2)
     and/or the right (1); thus LGRSH is a 1 because  it  matters
     whether its left operand is signed, but not its right.

     emit  is  straightforward, except for the cute way it inter‐
     acts with putasm, chread, and void to put out the right num‐
     ber  of strings from the character pool.  Watch the graves ‘
     carefully.

     fgen is the force table driver.  It gives  back  the  source
     operand if it’s volatile, then buys the desired destination.
     Setting up for the table expansion may  require  rescuing  a
     pointer  on top of stack and placing it (or a copy of it) in
     hl; this was an afterthought that notably simplified the ta‐
     bles.  The loop on table entries must succeed, since the ta‐
     bles are nominally complete, but code generation  may  still
     be  not possible because an auxiliary register is called for
     that isn’t available.

     pick and opick find an appropriate table entry for a partic‐
     ular  expression.   pick may be constrained to make an exact
     match of the left operand (match), or to accept  a  widening
     match  for  both  operands.  Note that for an exact match to
     work properly in opick, the operand must be fixed, i.e.  its
     f field must tell where it is located.

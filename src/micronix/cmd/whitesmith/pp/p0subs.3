     p0subs.c  contains  subroutines  used  by  parts of the pre‐
     processor; including define symbol table  management,  TLIST
     building, and define expansion.

     Many  routines  assume that token lists end in a PEOL token,
     and hence that token list pointers are never null.  All hell
     breaks loose when this assertion fails to hold.

     Definitions are installed in, looked up in, and deleted from
     the symbol table  using  a  hashing  algorithm.   Using  the
     hashtable  signifigantly  reduces  execution  time,  much of
     which is spent looking up identifiers.  A modicum of  tuning
     has  been  made  for  the size of NHASH, but little care has
     gone into the hashing algorithm.  The symbol  table  retains
     the logical appearance of a set of stacks, one per identifi‐
     er, while being implemented as a set of intertwined  stacks,
     one per hash key.

     pargs is the only routine, outside the C library, that knows
     the internal structure of FIO.  It must  have  an  allocated
     INCL structure, pointed at by pincl, with space to write out
     the #define statements that effectuate the ‐d  arguments  on
     the  command line.  This is why main makes the first call to
     nxtfile, and is careful to check it for success before call‐
     ing predef.

     The  dirty  trick noted in getfname is that buybuf will copy
     one more character than it should  from  p‐>text,  which  is
     later  overwritten  with a null character.  This is probably
     always safe, since the source is always the input buffer  in
     getln, which has a newline somewhere downstream of any iden‐
     tifier.

     The expansion of previously defined  identifiers  is  rather
     complicated.   doexp  is  called to expand a list of tokens.
     On finding a defined identifier, it converts the  definition
     text  to  a  token  list,  by  calling stotl.  It then calls
     getargs to build an ALIST for the arguments declared in  the
     defining  instance,  and passes the token list and the argu‐
     ment list to dodef.  dodef patches the token list  from  the
     definition into the token list of the original call.  It al‐
     so matches the ALIST of the definition to the  arguments  of
     the original call, and patches those tokens into place.  The
     code:

        for (px = pa‐>astart; px != pa‐>aend; px = px‐>next)
                {
                *qb = buytl(px, r‐>next);
                qb = &(*qb)‐>next;
                }

     is the heart of the matter.

     stotl converts a character string into  a  list  of  tokens.
     stotl  asserts  that the token list will always end with the
     end of line token (PEOL).  Other tokens  created  are  PNUM,
     PIDENT,  PCHCON,  PSTRING,  and  PPUNCT.   All whitespace is
     eliminated by stotl, which puts the  address  of  whitespace
     and the count of whitespace characters into the token.
